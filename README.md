## Objectives

Our project is a stock option dashboard that provides authentication, paper trading, and stock insights using data analytics and machine learning. The frontend is built with Next.js, the backend with FastAPI, and the database uses MongoDB, all hosted on Azure for scalability and reliability.

- Dashboard Base: All credit for the base layer of the dashboard page is attributed to Arham Khan @arhamkhnz, who created an open-source template for a [NextJS + ShadCN admin dashboard](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-shadcn-admin-dashboard). The template has no built-in functionality, it is simply a collection of ShadCN components put together in a very nice format. We have used this dashboard as a starting point for the appearance of the project, and have continued to expand upon it with actual functionality, new features and pages.
